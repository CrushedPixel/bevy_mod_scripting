## Summary 

### Fine grained imports & BMSPlugin
`BMSPlugin` is now all you need to add to your app following the selection of the features you care about:
```rust
  app.add_plugins(BMSPlugin);
```
Since this is a plugin group, you can also override any individual plugins that make up `BMS` by using `.set` i.e.:
```
  app.add_plugins(BMSPlugin.set(CoreScriptGlobalsPlugin::default()));
``` 

### Callback responses
It is now possible to request that a `ScriptCallbackResponseEvent` event is emitted on custom callbacks. 

You can do this at the time of creation of `ScriptCallbackEvent` triggers like so:
```rust
ScriptCallbackEvent::new_for_all(YourCallbackLabel, vec![my_arg])
 .with_response();
```

### Fixes
- since `0.11.0` the crate has silently been pulling in `mlua` with the `lua54` feature, which meant you could not select another lua version. This has been fixed
