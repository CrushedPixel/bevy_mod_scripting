## Summary 
- Dynamic Systems are here! [^1]
  - TODO
- `WithWorldGuard` and `HandlerContext<Plugin>` system parameters can be used in conjunction to create custom event handler systems
   ```rust
   fn my_handler(with_guard: WithWorldGuard<HandlerContext<Plugin>>) {
       let (guard, ctxt) = with_guard.get_mut();
       ctxt.call("my_script.lua", ...)
   }
   ``` 
- Global functions are now exported via the `ladfile_builder` plugin, BMS globals can be seen in the book
- `HashMap` fields can now be set by reflection
- Tuples now have a `FromScript` implementation

## Fixes
- `callback_labels!` allows for trailing commas
- `enable_context_sharing` not having a builder signature
- `HashMap`'s `FromReflect` supports `Vec` types meaning empty Lua maps `{}` work as expected 

## Changelog
See a detailed changelog [here](https://github.com/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

[^1] Experimental and early in development but here!
